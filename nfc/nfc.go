// Bought NXP MIFARE UltralightÂ® C 144 Byte RFID card, so only have 144 bytes to play with (137 if you ask nfc tools on
// android). This means we need to get somewhat creative in the storing of data unless I resort to storing just an id
// and then maintaining some sort of database later on. Currently "creative" should work fine.
